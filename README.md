# ising-model

The ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism  in statistical mechanics. This code uses MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo method) to calculate the internal energy, specific heat, magnetization, correlation function and character length.

##install
Run install.m in matlab. You should add the whole path of the code before using it. You can run start_up.m and then you could use the examples in example directory.
